# A class is like a blueprint for creating objects.
# For example, we can create many "Car" objects from one Car class.

class Car:
    # This is a method (function inside a class)
    def start(self):
        print("The car has started.")

# Create an object from the class
my_car = Car()

# Call the method using the object
my_car.start()
